# Mind Map Application

This project is a mind map application built using [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) within a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework. It allows users to create and customize mind maps with different colors for nodes and edges, and provides the functionality to download the map as an image.

## Features

- **Interactive Mind Mapping**: Build and manipulate mind maps with ease using React Flow's intuitive interface.
- **Customizable Nodes and Edges**: Assign different colors to nodes and edges for better organization and visualization.
- **Export as Image**: Download your completed mind map as an image for sharing and presentation purposes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
